    // Can not handle large integers!

    // Our solution is still slow!


// MARK: - Stress Test our Code:

    // Implementation

    // What is Stress Testing???
        // It is a program that generates random tests in an infinite loop, and
        // for each test, it launches your solution on this test and an alternative solution 
        // on the same test and compares the results.
    
        // Have to create the alternative solution and implement it yourself
    
        // ** The only requirement is that it should be significantly different from the main solution.

    

// MARK: - Notes on refactoring stress test

    // Made the range of numbers much smaller and made n smaller

    // Checking logic of both algorithms
        // One is multiplying the wrong number
            // Seems it can not multiply the same number if the number is the same as the first index!
